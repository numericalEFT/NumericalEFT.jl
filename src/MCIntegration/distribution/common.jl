function rescale(dist::AbstractVector, alpha=1.5)

Rescale the dist array to avoid overreacting to atypically large number.

There are three steps:
1. dist will be first normalize to [0, 1].
2. Then the values that are close to 1.0 will not be changed much, while that close to zero will be amplified to a value controlled by alpha.
3. In the end, the rescaled dist array will be normalized to [0, 1].
